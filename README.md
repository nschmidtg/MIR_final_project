# Music Information Retrieval Final Project

This repository contains two notebooks to i) compile a dataset from a subset of the VCTK speech dataset mixed with the most popular songs from the Jamendo Creative Commons Music Streming Service.
ii) Analyze this mixed dataset, called PodcastMix, and train two state-of-the-art architectures in the field of Source Separation: ConvTasNet and DPTNet.

If you want to compile the dataset by your own and tweak some parameters, you can run the FinalProject_dataset_creation Notebook in order to download the subset of the VCTK and the files from Jamendo.

If you want to start training and evaluating the models with the PodcastMix, you can go directly to the FinalProject_audio_process Notebook in order to analyze the dataset, train the networks and evaluate the separation.

All the requirements are installed in the same Notebooks, so there are no more requirements.
